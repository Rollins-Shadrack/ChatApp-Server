The chat app backend is built using Node.js and MongoDB. Node.js is used to handle the server-side logic while MongoDB is used as the database. The backend allows users to create accounts, send and receive messages, and join chat rooms. The app utilizes web sockets to enable real-time communication between users. The backend also includes features like user authentication, message encryption, and message history.
